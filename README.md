# 32-bit-pipelined-ARM-processor
The processor supports the following instructions:  • Data processing instructions where the second source can be either an immediate value or a source register, with no shifts. The data processing instructions must include ADD, SUB, AND, ORR, BIC, and EOR. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) must be extended to support all these instructions but try to minimize the number of logic gates in the ALU as much as you can. • The LDR and STR instructions with positive immediate offset (offset mode). • Branch instruction  Also, the processor must handle the following hazards: • Read After Write (RAW) Hazard • LDR Hazard • Control Hazards due to Branch or PC write
